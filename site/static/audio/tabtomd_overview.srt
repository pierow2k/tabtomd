1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Hey, everyone. You ever feel like, uh, like you're drowning in data,

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,720
spreadsheets and notes and just all over the place.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,340
And then like, you can't really get it to look nice when you're trying to use it,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,920
like for reports or, or, you know, notes or whatever you're working on.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:15,740
Exactly.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,500
Well, today we're diving into something that might just, uh, change all that for

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,340
you, tabtomd.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,380
Yeah. It really is like having a personal assistant,

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,560
but this assistant is really good at Markdown. Okay.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,920
And, you know, Markdown, that clean, readable format that everyone loves for like

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,960
documents and websites and stuff. Right. Yeah.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,420
tabtomd basically takes all your messy data, like, you know, tab delimited

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,560
stuff and poof, beautiful Markdown tables, just like appear

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,520
ready to be dropped into whatever you're working on.

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,640
Okay. So for people like me who haven't, you know,

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,020
lived their whole life in the command line. Sure.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,860
Can you explain what tabtomd about actually does? Like break it down a bit.

18
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,940
Absolutely. Yeah. So just imagine you've got like data that's trapped in a

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,000
spreadsheet. Okay. Yeah. Names and dates and numbers, all that.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,540
tabtomd just swoops in, takes all that and converts it into a super nicely

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,380
structured Markdown table. Nice.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,460
And the coolest part is that it can pull that data from a file or straight

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,700
from your clipboard. Oh,

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,280
so you don't even have to like copy and paste each little cell. Exactly.

25
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,560
No more of that tedious stuff. That's pretty awesome. It is.

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,540
So it's kind of like a formatting ninja that does all the boring work behind the

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,320
scenes. Exactly. So we can just, you know, focus on the important things. Yep.

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,120
Exactly that. Very cool. And it works really well with the command line.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,960
You know, that those command line interfaces you might've heard about,

30
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,420
it's basically a direct line to your computer.

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,480
So you type a command and it just does it. Sounds powerful. It is,

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,720
but it's not as scary as it sounds. That's good. Yeah.

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,240
So is it easy to get tabtomd set up? Yeah. Super easy.

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,940
If you're comfortable with go, it's just one command go install and you're done.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,900
Okay. And even if go sounds like something from another planet,

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,100
you can just clone the repository and build it manually.

37
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,400
The instructions are really clear site. They've made it easy for everyone.

38
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,120
Doesn't matter if you're a command line expert or just starting out.

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,020
That's great. Yeah.

40
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,140
So let's say we're convinced and we want to try it out. Okay.

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,420
What kind of commands can we use? Well,

42
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,880
the two main ones are file and paste.

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,440
So file is what you'd use if you have a whole spreadsheet or like a huge amount

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,540
of data you want to change.

45
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,960
You just tell tabtomd where that file is and it takes care of the rest,

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,100
turning it all into a nice markdown table. Nice. Yeah.

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,460
And paste is for when you're working with smaller bits of data, right?

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,860
Like if you just copied something from a spreadsheet. Exactly.

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
Paste is all about convenience. Okay.

50
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,440
So let's say you copied a couple rows of data.

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,300
Instead of formatting it yourself, you just run tabtomd to paste and boom,

52
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,640
you have a perfect markdown table ready to use. Wow.

53
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,100
So it's like a mini formatting fairy that lives on your clipboard.

54
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,060
Pretty much. Uh-huh. That's awesome. Yeah. It's super handy. I like it. Yeah.

55
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,360
Yeah. And if you want to go like from good tables to amazing tables,

56
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,280
tabtomd does this like secret weapon. Ooh, a secret weapon.

57
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,960
Okay. I'm listening. It's called the pretty flag. Okay. What does that do?

58
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,520
Well, you know how sometimes markdown tables can look kinda eh? Yeah.

59
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,400
Like not super aligned and stuff. Exactly. Yeah. A little messy. Yeah.

60
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,040
So this flag basically tells tabtomd, Hey,

61
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,520
make this look really good. Align everything perfectly. Okay.

62
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,260
So then all those vertical bars line up and the table just looks, you know,

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,480
really professional. I see.

64
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,380
So it's like the difference between a plain text document and like a polished

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,580
published report. Exactly. Just with this one little flag. That's cool.

66
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,640
I like that. Yeah. It makes a big difference for readability. I bet.

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,960
And the cool thing is tabtomd has even more features. Oh, really? Like what?

68
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,840
Like completion for people who like use those auto completion scripts in the

69
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,660
command line. Okay. And it also has a help command built in,

70
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,580
which is always nice. Yeah. Especially when you're trying to learn a new tool.

71
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,720
And of course it has versions so you can check if you have the latest

72
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,640
version. Nice.

73
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,480
So it sounds like they've really thought of everything to make it easy to use.

74
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,840
Yeah, they really have. And the community behind it is great too.

75
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,020
Super friendly and helpful. Well, that's awesome.

76
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,880
It's a really active open source community.

77
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,360
Everyone's always helping each other out. I love that.

78
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,840
It's so cool that they encourage people to contribute to the project too.

79
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,020
Yeah, definitely.

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,180
If you have an idea for a new feature or if you find a bug,

81
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,860
you can submit a pull request or open an issue on their repository.

82
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,640
That's great. So anyone can contribute.

83
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,200
Exactly. They welcome everyone's input,

84
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,320
which is what makes open source so powerful.

85
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,660
I agree. It's like a collective effort to make something amazing.

86
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,000
Exactly. So I have to ask, can we see tabtomd in an action?

87
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,940
Like an actual example. Of course.

88
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,380
Let's say you copied some data to your clipboard, just something simple,

89
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,240
like a list of names, ages, and cities. So like John, 30, New York,

90
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,540
then Jane, 25, London, all in a row. Okay. I'm picturing it.

91
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,560
With tabtomd you just type tabtomd paste pretty. With the pretty flag.

92
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,200
Yes. And that plain text instantly turns into a

93
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,220
beautiful, perfectly aligned markdown table.

94
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,480
Wow. So it just figures out the table structure on its own. Yep.

95
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,640
It automatically finds the header row,

96
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,400
puts the data into columns and adds all the markdown formatting.

97
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,700
That's really impressive. Yeah. It's like having a data assistant who knows

98
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,600
exactly how to organize everything. Very cool.

99
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,520
And what if we have like a whole spreadsheet full of data,

100
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,440
like a really big one? Then the file command is your best friend. Okay.

101
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,020
So let's say your data is in a file called data.txt.

102
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,120
You just type tabtomd file data.txt pretty and boom,

103
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,160
your whole file is a markdown table. Wow. That's so easy. Right.

104
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,620
It doesn't matter if it's a quick copy paste or a whole file,

105
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,580
tabtomd can handle it. And with the pretty flag, it'll always look amazing.

106
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,900
Exactly. I can definitely see why people love this tool.

107
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,280
It saves so much time and makes everything so organized.

108
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,240
It's not just about saving time though. A well formatted table makes the

109
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,560
data easier to understand, you know? Right.

110
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,320
Like you can actually see what's going on.

111
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,900
Exactly. And it helps you communicate your findings better,

112
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,660
whether it's a report for work or just your own notes. It's like, yeah,

113
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,120
it's like taking notes on a napkin versus like actually writing it down nicely.

114
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,660
Yeah, exactly. It makes a big difference. Huge difference. Yeah.

115
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,140
So it's not just data anymore. It's like information you can actually use and

116
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,320
share. Exactly. It makes it so much more clear. I like that.

117
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,320
And that's what's so great about tabtomd.

118
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,260
It's that bridge between the raw data and making it something understandable.

119
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,900
Yeah, I agree. So to sum it all up, tabtomd seems like it could be really

120
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,440
useful for anyone working with data. Absolutely.

121
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,280
Like it doesn't matter if you're a coder or just starting out.

122
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,740
It's simple to use. It can do a lot. And it has a great community behind it.

123
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,360
It really is a testament to the power of open source.

124
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,840
Like working together to create something amazing. I love that.

125
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,020
So now I have a challenge for you listening. Okay.

126
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,220
What data do you have that's just waiting to be turned into a beautiful

127
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,160
markdown table? Yeah. Give it a try. Yeah.

128
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,780
Try out tabtomd it and see how it can like, you know,

129
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,260
make your life easier and make your data look awesome.

130
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,180
Happy formatting everyone.
